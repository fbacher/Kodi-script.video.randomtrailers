This project is a resurection of the Kodi Random Trailers addon which has
been dormant since 2014 and which has not been functional for some time.

The goals of this project are:

1) To make the addon functional once more

2) To upgrade to Python 3 with Python 2 compatability

3) To modernize the code base: comply with Kodi and Python coding standard
as well as best practices.

4) To improve functionality and performance.

Work Items:

 * Support for non-English languages (text processing)
 * Messages for non-English
 * Non-English movies
 * Investigate non-US movie attributes (genres, ratings, etc.)
 
 * Better define filtering capabilities (genre(s), dates, etc.)
 * Consider generating/reading playlists
 * Consider randomizing over a larger universe of on-line movies rather than
   a fixed number of pages
   
 * Create common reusable core-engine plugin for script and screensaver versions
 * Migrate and test with Python 3
 * Bring to Kodi coding standards
 * Create test bed
 * Internal and external documentation
 * Get code review
