    Rough outline:
        Start separate threads to discover basic information about all selected
        video sources:
            1- library
            2- trailer folders
            3- iTunes
            4- TMDB
            5- (future) IMDB
        Each of the above store the discovered info into separate queues.
        The main function here is to discover the identity of all candidates
        for playing so that a balanced mix of trailers is available for playing
        and random selection. It is important to do this quickly. Additional
        information discovery is performed later, in background threads or
        just before playing the video.

        Immediately after starting the discovery threads, the player
        thread is started. The player thread:
            * Loops playing videos until stopped
            * On each iteration it gets movie a to play from
              TrailerManager's ReadyToPlay queue
            * Listens for events:stop & exit, pause, play, playMovie, showInfo,
              Skip to next trailer, etc.

        TrailerManager holds various queues and lists:
            * Queues for each video source (library, iTunes, etc.) for
                the initial discovery from above
            * Queues for discovering additional information
            * DiscoveredTrailers, a list of all videos after filtering (genre,
                rating, etc). This list grows during initial discovery
            * A small queue (about 5 elements) for each video source so that
                required additional information can be discovered just before
                playing the video. The queues provide enough of a buffer so
                that playing will not be interrupted waiting on discovery
            * The ReadyToPlayQueue which is a small queue containing fully
                discovered trailers and awaiting play. WAs trailers are played
                it is refilled from the small final discovery queues above
