         <!-- The different sources of certificat/rating information
                (TMDB, IMDB, iTunes, etc.) return different values. Further,
                certifications change over time. In the U.S., the Hays
                code was in effect through mid 1968. This code only had a
                rating of "Passed" (or "Approved"). The MPAA rating system
                started in 1968 and has had mulitple changes over time. For
                a while, there was an "M" (Mature) rating which later became
                "PG-13". There was a GP rating which later became "PG". TMDB
                currently only supports the current rating system.

                TMDB has no representation for older certification values
                    (i.e. 'M' for Mature or 'GP' now 'PG' or 'Passed' from pre-1968.

                The rules here provide a means to "scrape" the ratings stored
                in Kodi and convert them into a something which can be used to
                filter and compare with. The certification for a particular movie
                will come from Kodi. Each certification specifies a suggested
                approprate "age" of the viewer. This could be used for comparison,
                even between different country's rating systems (although
                different cultures have very different attitudes about what is
                appropriate for viewing). -->

             moderate swear words, infrequent strong language and moderate
             violence, sex references and nudity. Sexual activity may be briefly

             pornography, defined as material intended for sexual
             stimulation and containing clear images of real sexual
             activity, strong fetish material, explicit animated
             images, or sight of certain acts such as triple
             simultaneous penetration and snowballing. There remains
             a range of material that is often cut from the R18 rating:
             strong images of injury in BDSM or spanking works,
             urolagnia, scenes suggesting incest even if staged,
             references to underage sex or childhood sexual
             development and aggressive behaviour such as hair-pulling
             or spitting on a performer are not permitted. More cuts
             are demanded in this category than any other category.  -->
